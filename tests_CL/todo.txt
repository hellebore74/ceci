Batch job :

- define automatically the max number of processes (max nprocess values) 
- switch from one batch file to a serie of chained jobs that are launched one after the other
- switch to parsl (to be tested at CC-IN2P3):  each job environment can be setup ( use a bash file instead of using directly a python code)

Todo :
- test ceci[parsl] at CC-IN2P3
